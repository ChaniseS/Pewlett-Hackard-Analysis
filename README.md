## Summary:
I would think, speaking of the amount of employees that are set up to retire soon, that this would cause a panic in terms of production. However, because of the data and thinking ahead, there can be great strides made to ensure that the company is not heavily impacted.

**How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?**
Based the data, it seems that approx 90,000 employees.

**Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?**
Yes, definitely! The only department that may show an area of concern is the Manager department. They only have 2 members leaving.
